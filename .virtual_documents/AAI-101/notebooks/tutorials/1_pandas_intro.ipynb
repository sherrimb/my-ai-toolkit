# In Jupyter notebooks (and other interactive Python/IPython environments), simply typing the variable name in a cell (e.g. df) automatically calls the “display” mechanism, showing a formatted preview of that DataFrame in the notebook.

# In a regular Python script (for example, if you run python file.py from the command line), simply typing a variable name like df does nothing by itself. You would need to explicitly print it, for instance with print(df), to see any output.

# So, in short:

# In a notebook, df on its own line will display the DataFrame (because of the interactive environment’s display hook).
# In a regular Python program, you need print(df) (or some other method) to output or log the DataFrame to the console.
